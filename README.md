## Usage

### Dev mode

To run in dev mode, you will need the clojure cli
in your environment this could be access [here](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure).

After the cli installed in your system, we need to replicate the environment
variables in `.env` file. To do that, you can copy the `.env.example`
file and rename it to `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Also, in the terminal that you will run the application we can set the
environment variables with the following command:

```bash
set -a && source .env
```

Then, you can run the following command to start the application:

```bash
clj -A:dev:test
```

This will run the project with the dev and test profiles.

In the repl, you can run `(go)` to start the application.

### Test

We can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
clj -X:test
```

This will run all the tests of the project and will export a coverage report.

To run the cucumber tests, we can run the following command:

```bash
clj -M:test:cucumber -g ./test/mba_fiap/ ./test/resources/
```
